	<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently a high school English teacher at <a href="https://westspringfieldhs.fcps.edu/" target="_blank">West Springfield High School</a> in FCPS and 
working on a second master's degree in order to earn the plus 30 pay bump. I came into 
GMU under the Teaching Writing and Literature program but plan to switch to Professional 
and Technical Writing to broaden my resume.</p> 

<p>My family is made up of 1 husband, 2 children, 3 cats, and 2 dogs. My youngest child is a couple years away from graduating high school, and my husband and I are making plans for our future. We'd like to move south to a coastal area and work remotely. <strong>However, I do love teaching and being in a classroom with high schoolers!</strong></p>

<p>My hobbies include the following:</p>

	<h2>My Pets</h2>
 <p>My pets are all rescues. The cats were found by family in VA and SC, and then we took them in. Their names are Tacocat, Mochie, and Pixie Stix. Our dogs are rescues from <a href="https://www.wtarescue.com/" target="_blank">Wolf Trap Animal Rescue</a>. Their names are Maggie May and Loulou.</p>

<p>I have never done <em>anything</em> like this course requires! Learning something completely new is exciting but incredibly time-consuming.</p>
