<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am currently a high school English teacher at West Springfield High School in FCPS and 
working on a second master's degree in order to earn the plus 30 pay bump. I came into 
GMU under the Teaching Writing and Literature program but plan to switch to Professional 
and Technical Writing to broaden my resume.</p> 

<p>My family is made up of 1 husband, 2 children, 3 cats, and 2 dogs. My youngest child is a couple years away from graduating high school, and my husband and I are making plans for our future. We'd like to move south to a coastal area and work remotely. However, I do love teaching and being in 
a classroom with high schoolers.</p>

<p>My hobbies include the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reading</li>
		<li>Running</li>
		<li>Visiting breweries</li>
		<li>Weight lifting</li>
	</ul>
